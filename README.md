# Bubble Pop
Bubble Pop was made for the 2025 Global Game Jam at Northumbria University.
[Link to Northumbria's 2025 Global Game Jam Webpage](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2025/northumbria-university-ggj)

The idea of the game is to press the key shown on the bubble to "pop" the bubble. You get score for popping bubbles, and even more score for popping bubbles correctly and quickly.
